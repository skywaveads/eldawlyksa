## Overview

- Improved overall accessibility with proper ARIA attributes

### Header Component
- Implemented proper hamburger menu for mobile navigation (< 768px)
- Added smooth animations for mobile menu with slide transitions
- Improved mobile menu organization and touch targets
- Made logo size responsive (smaller on mobile, larger on desktop)
- Fixed header positioning with proper z-index
- Improved dropdown menu behavior with proper transitions
- Added event listeners to close mobile menu on navigation and window resize
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA roles and states

### Layout Component
- Added dynamic spacing to accommodate fixed header

### Footer Component

## Technical Improvements

## Breakpoints
The application now uses consistent breakpoints:
- Mobile: < 576px
- Large mobile: 576px - 767px
- Tablet: 768px - 991px
- Desktop: â‰¥ 992px

All layouts gracefully degrade to screen sizes as small as 320px.

## Testing Notes
